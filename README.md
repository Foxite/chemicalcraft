# chemicalcraft

Lead coder: Foxite

This is the private repository for ChemicalCraft, a chemistry mod for Minecraft. It has not yet been released. I am not looking for help with coding or design, but if you are interested in texturing, don't hestitate. Please contact me at d.kok.2000@gmail.com, and **NOT** the email address that I have registered this Github account with. You may try this mod at any time by downloading and compiling the source, and you may file bug reports as you please. Please don't file pull requests, they will be ignored.
